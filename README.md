# Aegistrate - A very obvious portmanteau

Aegistrate is *yet another moderation/general-purpose Discord bot*, but it's open source and has none of that corporate/monetization thing that most other product do. *(subtle shade who?)*

## How is Aegistrate different?

### Commmunity bot and everything's-free motto

In this product, I (@developer-ramen) try my very best to add features at a constant pace, as well as keep everything **free and available** for everyone.

### Open-source and easily self-hostable

I also intend to offer a **self-hosting solution** - one that you can easily and conveniently set up for yourself. Although it definitely takes a little knowledge of setting up your own environment and coding, I **recommend** this over inviting the community bot to your server 10 times out of 10.

In fact, **self-hosting** is the only option anyways, so I guess you'll just have to get used to it.

## Features

My goal is to make every feature you have in mind come true, **quality-over-quantity fashion**.

Some prominent features we have include:
- can we update this section anytime soon? yeah, thanks

Some prominent feature **ideas** include:
- `/punish` - where one can actually set up a punishment hierarchy instead of having to manually use `/ban`, `/kick`, or `/timeout`.
- `/stats` and more advanced server statistics visualisations.
- `/lockdown` and other panic-mode suggestions for when the server gets hits by things like raids or a 10-year-old moderator going bonkers.
- `/fun-stuff` and an infinitely-expanding list of miscellaneous, fun commands.

## Setup instructions

### For the tech-oriented folks

You know what to do. Docs are in the `docs/` folder.

### For the less experienced

can we get this filled out sometime in the future? yeah, thanks

### Footnote - A statement on my sentiment about commercially-charged products like MEE6

I have nothing against MEE6 (or at least don't want to do any harm or spread any bad), or any other businesses with products here on Discord, nor do I expect anyone working on this project to be so.

This project's branding and appearance screams anti-MEE6, but I do not have or want to have any ill-intents against the product and their company. After all, a Discord bot is something that was made by people, who then needed to be compensated. In the same vein, Sidescroll Ventures found that their Discord bot was a good way to make money, so they did use MEE6 as a way to make money.

I think it is sometimes funny and hilarious to clown on cash-grabby thingmiums that people make, but as long as it does not harm anyone or does any illegal things, it is none of my business to try to strike it down or do anything to the people involved in it.

I don't expect any compensation for me, or for this project - if I needed to make money I'll just hit up one of those people who DM'ed me about a drop-shipping position they opened up 3 months ago, which is way simpler than making a Discord bot.

I'm writing an essay here, but you get the point. It's my job to make good of Aegistrate, not to make fun of MEE6 or any other bot that makes money. I appreciate you for reading through my messy writing, and I hope you share my sentiments about this as well.
